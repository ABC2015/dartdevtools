### Note for New Packages

For new packages that have not been around for six months or longer, there are three options to increase the community visibility of your package:




1. **Join the Discord Community**: Submit a link to your package in the "new-package" channel for free. This channel is designed for new packages that others may be interested in.
2. **Advertise on Dart Code Labs**: Feature your package under the "new-package" category on dartcodelabs.com. This service allows one of our Dart developers to create an honest and unbiased code lab review of your package. This is available for a one-time fee. Updated reviews are charged at the same rate.
3. **Own Your Channel**: Opt for a dedicated channel exclusively for your framework or library. This service comes with a monthly fee, billed annually. Having a dedicated channel helps you engage directly with the community and provide focused support.


Thank you for your submission! We will review the package based on the above criteria to ensure it is active and maintained.
